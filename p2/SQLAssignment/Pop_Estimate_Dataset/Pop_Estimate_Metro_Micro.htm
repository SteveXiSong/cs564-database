The estimates are based on the 2010 Census and reflect changes to the April 1, 2010 population due to the 
Count Question Resolution program and geographic program revisions. 

Total population change includes a residual.  This residual represents the change in population that cannot 
be attributed to any specific demographic component. See Population Estimates Terms and Definitions at
&lt;http://www.census.gov/popest/about/terms.html&gt;.

The Office of Management and Budget's statistical area delineations for metropolitan and micropolitan
statistical areas, as well as metropolitan divisions, are those issued by that agency in February 2013 
&lt;http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg_statpolicy#ms&gt;.

The metropolitan and micropolitan statistical area population estimates are based upon the county estimates.
